# Unit-4-Game
This is a Star Wars fighting Game. Each character has their own stats and you must find the right combinations in order to win. You can start with any character, but some might need to power up before standing a chance of beating the stronger characters. 

**How it works**
1. You must hit the "Start Button" in order for the game to begin.
2. If you want to fight with a character, you must select the "Defend As" button. This will cause you character to move into the Defending area.
3. Next you must select an enemy. This is done by selecting the "Attack" button next to the character. This will cause them to move to the Battle Grounds. 
4. In order to do any damage, the "Attack Enemy" button must be pressed.
5. After you defeat an enemy,the character will disappear from the board. You'll need to select a new one by pressing the attack button. Continue this until all enemy characters have been defeated.
6. In order to stop or restart the game select "Stop Game".
7. Upon winning the game Darth Vader will say "Most impressive." and Green Text will say "You Win".
8. Upon losing the game Darth Vader will say "You have failed me for the last time" and Red Text will say "Game Over".
